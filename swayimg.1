.SH SYNOPSIS
swayimg [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fIFILE\fR|\fIDIR\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBswayimg\fR utility can be used for preview images inside the currently
focused window (container).
.PP
The program uses Sway IPC to determine the geometry of the currently focused
workspace and window.
This data is used calculate the position and size of a new window.
Then the program adds two rules to the Sway: "floating enable" and
"move position" for \fBswayimg\fR application, creates a new Wayland window and
draws an image from the specified file.
.PP
When no files or directories are supplied on command line current working
directory will be opened.
